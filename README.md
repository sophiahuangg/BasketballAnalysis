# BasketballAnalysisProject

In this project, I will be working with data that details the Dallas Maverick's 2021-2022 regular season in the NBA. The NBA stands for the National Basketball Association, and it is split into an Eastern and Western Conference. The Dallas Mavericks are part of the NBA's Western Conference, and I chose to analyze this team by using a random NBA team generator. Specifically, I will be looking at their traditional box scores, advanced box scores, and their overall team performance in each game. The box scores tell us how each player on the team performed in each game and gives an overall summary of the game. 
## Data Source:

All of the data used to create the CSV files and conduct analysis on are from the [NBA Website](https://www.nba.com/). However, I was gained access to all of this data through Swar's [NBA API](https://github.com/swar/nba_api). Big thanks to Swar for creating this awesome tool that allows us to webscrape from the NBA page.
